Password Security &amp; Authentication Analysis.
This project demonstrates basic password security concepts using a simple and easy-to-understand application. The aim is to understand how weak passwords and insecure hashing methods can lead to account compromise, and how strong authentication mechanisms improve security.

Objective

To analyze password storage methods and compare weak and strong hashing algorithms used in authentication systems.

Tools Used

CyberChef (Web-based application)

Windows Operating System

Web Browser

Methodology

Entered weak and strong passwords into the application

Generated hashes using MD5 and bcrypt

Observed differences in hash outputs

Analyzed why weak passwords are easily compromised

Studied the role of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Key Findings

Weak passwords generate predictable hashes

MD5 is insecure and easily cracked

bcrypt provides strong, salted password hashing

MFA significantly reduces the risk of account takeover

Conclusion

Strong passwords, secure hashing algorithms, and multi-factor authentication are essential for protecting modern applications from password-based attacks.
